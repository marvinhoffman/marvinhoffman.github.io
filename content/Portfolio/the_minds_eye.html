<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Kathy turned the eye of the stove on; the blood red coil searing the events of the evening into her mind, giving her a feeling of disturbing euphoria. Hands shaking, she poured the stewed tomatoes into a sauce pan, and added the dried noodles. <i>These are Ted’s favorite</i>, Kathy thought as the whole tomatoes slid from the can into the pot. Glancing into the living room as she walked to the rubbish bin, Kathy could just see the edge of Ted’s slippers resting on the floor in front of the couch. <i>God, he would watch that Fox News all day and night if he could, </i>Kathy thought.  Outside a storm blew in with a shrug, the colorless town yawned in its bed of apathy.  Stirring the darkening concoction, Kathy’s mind wandered down a familiar path. <i>Oh Ted, you and your fanciful dreams, you have no idea how many times I’ve saved you from hurt.</i>Images of Ted’s gleaming eyes when he’d bound up the stairs with some new fool idea. Like the camper.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Kathy! What if we bought a camper,” Ted had said.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“We could take some of our friends and tour the campgrounds in the state. I’ve got some brochures here; let’s take a look at them!”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Well Ted that is quite an idea. How much do campers cost?” Kathy had said.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Well, we have a few options. I could rig up a hitch on our station wagon and get a little camper to pull behind it. I asked a fellow at the parts store, and he said our wagon could handle a nice little airstream.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Do you <i>really</i> feel comfortable putting all these people in danger with your ‘rigging’ of a hitch?” Kathy had said. “And this sounds awfully expensive, remember we have to prepare for our retirement, you know how these politicians are, they are already spending our social security money”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Oh I know that Kathy,” Ted said. “And I know we have to take care of ourselves, no one else will! But I feel like I need to live a little now, not just put it all off until I retire. I sometimes wonder if I’ll make it that long.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Oh don’t be silly Ted, I take good care of you, and when you listen to what I and the doctor say, you will stay healthy as a horse.”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Kathy broke out of her reverie and saw that the sauce was just starting to move as the pan heated. Kathy gave it another stir nudging the veined tomatoes, looking like little hearts, then placed the lid on the pan and turned it down to simmer. As the lid ‘clinked’ onto the pan, in the living room a single sanguine drop coalesced from the fabric of the couch cushion and dropped to the floor.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Kathy busied herself around the kitchen. <i>Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today,</i> was Kathy’s motto. One of Kathy’s mottos, as Kathy had a never-ending supply of mottos to apply to those around her, and even sometimes to herself. <i>Just take the time Ted got it into his head that he should get a job with the National Park Service. Oh there had been quite a row with that one! Ted had really gotten himself worked up until he finally saw the light of the merits of staying with the company he had been with for fifteen years already.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i><i></i></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“You’re building equity in yourself.” Kathy had asserted.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“Actually I’m building equity in a company and group of executives who don’t care about anything other than their bottom line!” Ted had said.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1"><i>That was so like my Teddy boy, really just a boy at heart, and he does so need a mum.</i><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Ted continued, “My equity is in myself, and my abilities, and in my heart. Kathy honey, nothing makes my heart beat stronger than to be out in the boundless beauty of nature!”</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">“I know that Teddy honey, I know you think that’s what you want, and I’m sure you’ve convinced yourself of that. You are very convincing you know, and I love it when you show your fervency. But, you know how valuable you are to your company. You know how much they need you. You do have an obligation to them and honestly to me to be a faithful employee, and a faithful provider. “Ted always visibly winced when Kathy would utter the word ‘but’, just another way Kathy knew that he was listening. And listening is important.  Ted turned and walked away calling over his shoulder, “Don’t call me Teddy.” Kathy just smiled; this was how she knew that he Teddy was seeing reason.</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The storm outside blew tiny raindrops against the window causing a subtle ‘swish’ as a broom were brushed against the pane. Kathy glanced into the living room and saw lethargic flash of lightning off in the distance. Her eyes slowly moved to the television, where the darkened image of a car swerving on a dark road to avoid hitting a deer reflected Ted sitting on the couch. Ted’s head was lolled to the side, and the shadowy trail of a rivulet of blood echoed the forked shape of the lightning. The car commercial ended, and the local news came on with a silly story about another company filing bankruptcy. Kathy had told Ted that this would pass, and she considered calling down there to the news station and giving them a piece of her mind. “This is just fear-mongering,” Kathy said flatly!  Kathy’s reverie was interrupted by the dancing ‘tink’ of the lid on the pan. The smell of the torrent of tomatoes writhing among the pasta made Kathy feel grounded. A quick stir with the wooden spoon, and then Kathy’s favorite part: Popping the fleshy tomatoes, halving them so the pasta could soak up all that good juice. Oh Ted will just love this.</span></p>
