Marvin L. C. Hoffman is a fiction author specializing in thrillers and crime dramas. With a background in Navy nuclear submarines, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and software engineering, Marvin draws inspiration from a multitude of life experiences. His stories explore regular people responding to and (hopefully) overcoming life-altering events.



Marvin is currently working on an Appalachian crime drama as well as a crime thriller set in '80s Las Vegas. When not writing, he can be found in the woods hiking, on the water in his lake kayak, or quite possibly rolling dice at a D&D table.
