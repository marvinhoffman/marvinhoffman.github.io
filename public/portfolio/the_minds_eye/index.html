Hands shaking, she poured the peeled tomatoes into a saucepan, and added the dried noodles. <em>These are Teddy’s favorites</em>, Kathy thought glancing into the living room as she walked to the rubbish bin, Kathy could just see the edge of Ted’s slippers resting on the floor in front of the couch. <em>God, he would watch that idiot box all day and night if he could,</em> Kathy thought.</p>
<p>Outside, a storm that earlier had moved in with a shrug was now growing restless. Flickers of lightning cast shadows through the kitchen window. A brilliant flash startled Kathy.</p>
<p>“Teddy darling, you really should turn that TV off. The lightning is going to burn it out.”</p>
<p><em>Oh Teddy, I’m always taking care of you, and Lord knows you need it</em>. Kathy’s mind wandered down familiar paths. <em>You and your fanciful dreams Teddy, you have no idea how many times I’ve saved you from hurt.</em> Kathy remembered so many times when Ted would bound up the stairs with some new – foolish in her mind – idea. The camper for instance, <em>seriously Teddy, don’t you think things through</em>?</p>
<p>“Kathy! What if we bought a camper! We could take some of our friends and tour the campgrounds in the state. I’ve got some brochures here; let’s take a look at them!” Ted said. The excitement lighting his typically dull eyes.</p>
<p>“Well Teddy that is quite an idea. How much do campers cost?”</p>
<p>“Well, we have a few options. I could rig up a hitch on our station wagon and get a little camper to pull behind it. I asked a fellow at the auto parts store, and he said our wagon could handle a nice little airstream.”</p>
<p>“Do you really feel comfortable putting all these people in danger with your ‘rigging’ of a hitch?” Kathy warned icily. “And this sounds awfully expensive, remember we have to prepare for our retirement, you know how these politicians are, they are already spending our social security money.”</p>
<p>“Oh I know that Kathy,” Ted countered. “And I know we have to take care of ourselves, no one else will! But I feel like I need to live a little now, not just put it all off until I retire. I sometimes wonder if I’ll make it that long.”</p>
<p>“Oh don’t be silly Teddy, I take good care of you, and if you will listen to me, you will stay healthy as a horse.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen some sick old nags.” Ted said as he grumbled back to the stairs. “And don’t call me Teddy.”</p>
<p>“What was that Teddy?” Kathy said without even a glance in Ted’s direction.</p>
<p>“Nothing dear.”</p>
<p>Kathy’s attention was drawn back to the present. Like little pulsing hearts, the veined-tomatoes began to writhe in the heat. With this movement, Kathy gave the concoction another stir, placed the lid on the pot and began the simmer. At the same time as the lid clinked onto the pan, a single dark red drop formed on the fabric of the couch behind Ted’s head. The drop coalesced and dropped to the floor deepening the stain on the carpet.</p>
<p>Kathy busied herself around the kitchen. <em>Never put off until tomorrow what you can do today,</em> was Kathy’s motto. Kathy had a never-ending supply of mottos to apply to those around her… and occasionally even to herself. <em>Just take the time Teddy got it into his head that he should get a job with the National Park Service. Oh there had been quite a row with that one! Teddy had really gotten himself worked up until he finally the merits of staying with the company he had been with for fifteen years already.</em></p>
<p>“You’re building equity in yourself.” Kathy had asserted.</p>
<p>“Actually I’m building equity in a company and group of executives who don’t care about anything other than their bottom line!” Ted said bordering on insolence. “They certainly don’t care about my bottom line.”</p>
<p><em>That was so like my Teddy, really just a boy at heart, and he does so need a mum, my little Teddy boy.</em></p>
<p>Ted continued, “My equity is in myself, and my abilities, and in my heart. Kathy honey, nothing makes my heart beat stronger than to be out in the boundless beauty of nature!”</p>
<p>“Oh Teddy darling, I know you think that’s what you want, and I’m sure you’ve convinced yourself of that. You are very convincing you know, and I love it when you stand up for what you think you believe in. But, you know how valuable you are to your company. You know how much they need you. You do have an obligation to them and honestly to me to be a faithful employee, and a faithful provider. “</p>
<p>Ted winced when Kathy uttered the word ‘but’, then turned and walked away calling over his shoulder, “Don’t call me Teddy.” Kathy just smiled; this was how she knew that he was seeing reason.</p>
<p>The storm outside blew tiny raindrops against the window causing a subtle ‘swish’ like a broom brushing against the pane. Kathy glanced into the living room, her eyes slowly moving to the television, its warm glow framing the scene. Ted sitting on the couch, his head lolled to the side, the shadowy trail of blood from the hole in his temple gleamed in the ethereal light. A car commercial ended, and the local news came on with a recap of an earlier <em>silly</em> story about another company filing bankruptcy. <em>Oh big</em> news, Kathy thought. She had told Ted that this would pass. Kathy had even considered calling down there to the news station and giving them a piece of her mind. “This is just fear-mongering,” Kathy would tell them flatly! Kathy’s reverie was interrupted by the dancing ‘tink’ of the lid on the pan. The smell of the torrent of tomatoes writhing among the pasta made Kathy feel grounded. A quick stir with a wooden spoon, and then Kathy’s favorite part: Popping the fleshy veined hearts, halving them so the pasta could soak up all that good juice. <em>Oh Teddy will just love this.</em></p>
