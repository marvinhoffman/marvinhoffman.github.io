      <description>&lt;p&gt;“You ripped my scab you shithead.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lonnie held his arm up to my face, “I ought to make you eat it Harmon.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“You did it L-Lonnie.” I said. “You di- did it trying to take my lunch box.” My voice hitching as I barely held back the tears.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Only a queer would have a Scooby-Do lunch box Harmon. And you’re a damned queer if I ever saw one.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was an understatement that Lonnie Stokes was the bane of my existence on my bus rides home. I watched as Lonnie picked at the scab — one of three perfect little circles on his left arm. His hair stuck out every which way; especially the hair around his ears, swooping up to the skies, making his John Deere hat look like a bird about to take flight. His t-shirt had a rip under the right sleeve, and I could see a purplish bruise with yellow edges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
